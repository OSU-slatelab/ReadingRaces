# ReadingRaces

This project is still in the early stages of development.

This tool is a standalone enhancment to ReadingRaces, an oral reading fluency tutor. The tool predicts pronunciation of new vocabulary found in stories added by the user, using the word spelling and a sample utterance. The project has dependencies on Phonetisaurus and PocketSphinx.
